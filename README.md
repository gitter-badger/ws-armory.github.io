## Overview ##

The main idea of this project is to provide a way for [Wildstar](http://wildstar-online.com/) players to share a link to their equipment (to post it on forums or in a guide for example).

The [website](http://ws-armory.github.io/) for two things: visualize the equipments and get a shorten version of the link for sharing purpose.

It is possible to get a link (in-game) to your current equipment using the [Armory addon](http://http://curse.com/project/225711) for Wildstar. It is also possible to build your own list ([more](#)).


## Developer Notes ##

### How does it work ###

Wildstar in-game API exposes unique _#_ to reference each objects, this objects can be found in different online databases such as [Jabbithole](http://www.jabbithole.com).

Items names and pretty tooltip view are generated using the [Jabbithole](http://www.jabbithole.com) tooltips JavaScript API which takes this items unique _#_ as parameter.

The in-game addon gather couples of (_slot_id_, _item_id_) then generates a link to the website based on this couples.

The [goo.gl](http://goo.gl/) url shortening API is used to generate short links.

Everything is done a static way using JavaScript.


### TL;DR ###
```http
GET ws-armory.github.io/?0=1234&Wonderful%20Item=4321
```
gives
```html
<section id="main">
  <table id="items">
    <thead>...<thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td class="slot">Chest</td><td class="item"><a href="http://jabbithole.com/items/1234">Chest name</a></td></tr>
      <tr><td class="slot">Wonderful Item</td><td class="item"><a href="http://jabbithole.com/items/4321">Wonderful Item name</a></td></tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</section>
```
and
```
http://ws-armory.github.io/v?XYZXY
```


### The query string ###

The query string of the page is composed by key-values couples such as (_slot_, _item_id_). The _slot_ key can either be a slot _#_ or a slot name.

If a slot _#_ is given the slot will be named following this table:

| id | Name              | id | Name              |
|----|-------------------|----|-------------------|
| 0  | Chest             | 8  | Support System    |
| 1  | Legs              | 9  | Key               |
| 2  | Head              | 10 | Implant           |
| 3  | Shoulder          | 11 | Gadget            |
| 4  | Feet              | 15 | Energy Shield     |
| 5  | Hands             | 16 | Weapon            |
| 6  | Tool              | 17 | Bag               |
| 7  | Weapon Attachment |    |                   |

If the slot _#_ is not found in the table, it's keeping it's orinal value (42 will be kept as 42).

Parameters are gathered using JavaScript, the page is then built dynamically.

Items _#_ are then converted to item names using the [Jabbithole](http://www.jabbithole.com) tooltips JavaScript API. This API also add a fancy tooltip widget (on mouse hover).

Here is some examples of valid links to the equipment with id `#1234` (which is a weapon):
* http://ws-armory.github.io/?16=1234
* http://ws-armory.github.io/index?16=1234
* http://ws-armory.github.io/index.html?16=1234

#### Building custom lists ####
You can build custom lists by specifying the slot names as key of the query string. You can add as much items you want as long as the URL size do not excess 256 characters.

Here are some samples of custom lists:
* http://ws-armory.github.io/?Weapon=1234&Uber%20Weapon=4321&Wondeful%20Chest=9999
* http://ws-armory.github.io/?16=1234&14=4321&Alternative%20Weapon=9999


### Page template ###

The (_slot_,_item_) couples will be output in a table following this structure:

```html
<section id="main">
  <table id="items">
    <thead>...<thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr><td class="slot">SLOT_NAME</td><td class="item"><a href="#LINK">ITEM_NAME</a></td></tr>
      <tr>...</tr>
      ...
    </tbody>
  </table>
</section>
```

The _table_ (in the section `main`) have the id `items`, slot name's _td_ will have the class `slot`, item ones will have the class `item`.


### URL shortening ###

The [goo.gl](http://goo.gl/) url shortening [API](https://developers.google.com/url-shortener/) is used to generate short links.

You can see that links does have the `goo.gl/XYZXY` format but `ws-armory.github.io/v?XYZXY`, it's mainly for security reasons: a `goo.gl` link can point to anything, ws-armory links can only reference ws-armory pages.

This is done this way:

* Creating an ID

The _Share_ button is pressed and the JavaScript library generates a link based on the URL of the current page: `http://ws-armory.github.io/?16=12345&14=12346` gives `http://goo.gl/XYZXY` that gives `http://ws-armory.github.io/v?XYZXY`.

* Loading an ID

When the _v.html_ page gets a request, the JavaScript library first look for the long version of the url: `http://ws-armory.github.io/v?XYZXY` gives `http://goo.gl/ + XYZXY` that gives `http://ws-armory.github.io/?16=12345&14=12346`.

It's then extract the query string of the URL and redirect to the items page: `http://ws-armory.github.io/?16=12345&14=12346` gives `?16=12345&14=12346` that is used to get `http://ws-armory.github.io/ + ?16=12345&14=12346` for the redirection.

Doing such a thing avoid users to redirect on non-armory pages using an ws-armory link.


### Application Backend ###
For the moment everything on the website is done a static way using HTML and JavaScript, there is no backend (such as J2EE, PHP, RoR, ...).

I would like to keep it working like this as much time as possible not to have to deal with web hosting and service maintenance.

Nevertheless, if think of a killer feature and you really need to base it on a backend-oriented solution, we can [discuss](https://gitter.im/ws-armory/chat) about it, I'm open to any suggestions that will allow to improve the website.
